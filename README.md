# flutter_software_embedder

This project is an example flutter software embedder which renders Flutter application **inside a terminal** using Sixel graphics ðŸŽ¯

This project provides a **custom Flutter embedder** that runs Flutter engine output directly in terminals supporting sixel, allowing full Flutter UI inside a terminal window (e.g., *xterm*, *rxvt*) with sixel-enabled VTE implementations.
